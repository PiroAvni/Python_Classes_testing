## Brief

### Variables playground

- Create a variable that contains a whole number
- Print out the type of that number using a built-in function
- Change the type of the number to be a float
- Write the following sentences and store it in a variable: `I’m learning python for the very first time this morning! We’re having a great time`
- Try doing this with a pair of double quotes ( “ ) and a pair of single quotes outside ( ‘ ). Can you notice a difference? <br />
_You might need to use the escape character `\` so that you can store the string surrounded by single quotes._
- Use the escape character to print each sentence on a new line.
- Print out the sentences all in upper case to show your excitement.
- Split the paragraph into two sentences and store the first sentence in a new variable. You’ve just made your first list!
- Create a list of three numbers. <br />
_Lists are denoted by `[]`, ordered and changeable_
- Print out the first element of your list
- Change the third element of your list
- Create a tuple containing three strings. <br />
_Tuples are denoted by `()`, ordered and unchangeable_
- Print out the last element of your tuple
- Check if your tuple contains ‘hello’
- Create a dictionary containing three pieces of information about you: your name, python skill level (on a scale of 1 - 5) and if you have had a coffee or not this morning.. <br />
_Dictionaries are made up of key, value pairs. Key’s will always be strings, values can be any data type. Dictionaries are denoted by `{}` and key, value pairs are separated by colons. Dictionaries are unordered, changeable and indexed_
- Print out your name
- Update your python skill level to be one level higher than you originally put it
- Add another element that is a tuple that contains the other programming languages you know.
- Create a set that contains your favourite foods
_Sets are denoted by `{}` and are unordered._
- You cannot change existing items in a set, but you can add or remove items from it. Replace one of your favourite foods.
- Print out how many items are in your set

### Functions playground

- Create a new file.
- Create two variables, one that contains the name of your hometown and one that contains statistics about your hometown.
- Create a function that calculates the population density of your hometown, you might need to add more statistics to your statistics variables now.
- Create a function that returns a sentence telling users the population density of your hometown
- Call the function and print it out.
- What happens if there is no hometown variable stored, can we put a default in place instead?
- Can you reduce the number of lines of code you’ve written. Spend some time refactoring.

### Procedural Python challenges

- Make a program that counts down from 10 to 0 but instead of 0 it says `Boom`
- Make a program that iterates through two lists of names and finds if there are any repeated names
- Make a `name_generator` module with two methods
    - `dragon_name`
        - takes a person's first name and month of birth
        - returns their dragon name (you decide how this is formed!)
    - `penguin_name`
        - takes a person's first name and month of birth
        - returns their penguin name (you decide how this is formed!)
- Make an `app.py` file that runs a game loop
    - User is asked for their name and month of birth
    - User is asked if they want their dragon name or penguin name
    - User is shown their new name!
    - User stays in game until they decide to leave
    - User can type in `exit` at any time to exit the program
