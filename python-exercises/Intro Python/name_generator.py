# In the code above, a NameGenerator class is defined with two static methods: dragon_name and penguin_name.

# The dragon_name method takes a person's first name and month of birth as parameters. You can define your own logic to generate dragon names based on these inputs. In this example, the dragon name is formed by capitalizing the first name and adding "the Dragon" at the end.

# The penguin_name method also takes a person's first name and month of birth as parameters. Similarly, you can define your own logic to generate penguin names based on these inputs. In this example, the penguin name is formed by capitalizing the first name and adding "the Penguin" at the end.
